# Alaska Code Challenge

This is a SPA to allow users to search for flights based on origin and destination airports.  The resulting table of flights is sortable on all columns, in both ascending and descending order.  Look for the chevron in the column header to determine sort order.  Clicking toggles between ascending sort, descending sort, and no sort.  This application has been tested in Internet Explorer, Microsoft Edge, and Google Chrome.

### Setup

To run, simply add the locations of the necessary data .csv files to the Web.Config file in the <appSettings> section.  Then build, compile, and run.  Note that the Visual Studio Solution file is inside Flights.Web
